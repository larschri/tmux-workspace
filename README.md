# tmux-workspace

Simple program to create a tmux workspace consisting of three panes, with layouts hardcoded to my personal preferences. It can flip between two layouts; one with three columns, intended for wide (4k-ish) screens; and one for smaller screens based on the _main-vertical_ layout. The layouts consists of two smaller panes and one large pane where I keep my main activity.

A workspace is created by supplying a directory parameter that is used to named the window.
